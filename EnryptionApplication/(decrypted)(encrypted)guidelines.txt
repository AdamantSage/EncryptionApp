Encryption and Decryption Project
(Semester project)
An encryption algorithm is the method used to transform data into ciphertext. An 
algorithm will use the encryption key in order to alter the data in a predictable way, 
so that even though the encrypted data will appear random, it can be turned back 
into plaintext by using the decryption key.
1. Use an encryption algorithm (DES, AES, blowfish, Twofish etc.) to encrypt and 
decrypt a file.
● The algorithm must be able to encrypt and decrypt images, text files, zip files
and powerpoints.
2. You may only use Python or Java as a Programming language.
3. You MUST create your own encryption and decryption algorithm, thus two 
different algorithms (generic algorithm like DES and your groups own algorithm)
4. A document must be submitted with the following information:
● § why you chose the encryption method
● § what are the advantages and disadvantages of this algorithm
● § explain your own algorithm in detail 
5. You can work in groups of 4 - 5
6. Project must be done and demonstrated from the 15th until the 25th of May 2023.
● Time slots will be made available. 
7. You will be able to rate your teammates after the project is marked. All reviews will 
be kept private. You will only get the marks you deserve. If you do 50% of the work, 
you will get 50% of your group's mark.
8. The video uploaded on efundi is only a guideline, do not follow it step by step. 
9. On efundi a marking scheme is available.
YOU WILL RECEIVE ZERO IF ANY CODE IS PLAGARISED!!! NO EXCEPTIONS!!
If you have any questions, please email me.
